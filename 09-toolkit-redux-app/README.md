# Project #6 - 09-toolkit-redux-app

## Description

The project is a web application that combines two features: a simple counter and the display of information about pokemon obtained from the Poke API. Redux Toolkit will be used to manage the state of the application, and Jest will be used to write automatic tests that ensure the correct operation of both the counter and the integration with the Poke API.
