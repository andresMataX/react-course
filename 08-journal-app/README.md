# Project #5 - 08-journal-app

## Description

The project is a web application that allows users to create journal notes, save titles, descriptions, and even images associated with each entry. The app uses Firebase as the backend platform to store and manage the notes in the Firestore, and Jest is used to write automated tests that ensure the integrity and functionality of the app.
