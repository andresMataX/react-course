# Project #4 - 07-heroes-spa

## Description

The project is a single page application (SPA) that allows users to explore and search for information about Marvel and DC Comics heroes. Users will be able to view hero details, compare stats, save favorite heroes, and discover interesting information about their favorite characters. The main goal of this project is to build an interactive experience using React, get hero data from external sources, and ensure code quality with automated testing using Jest.
