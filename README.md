## üìö Descriptions

### Project #1 | 03-counter-app-vite

#### Description

The project is a simple web application that allows users to increment or decrement a counter and see its value updated on screen. The main goal of this project is to provide a clear and concise example of how to build a basic React application and how to write automated tests using the Jest testing framework.

### Project #2 | 04-giff-app

#### Description

The project is a web application that allows users to search for GIFs based on their search queries. It uses the Giphy API to get search results in real time and display the corresponding GIFs on the screen. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to build an interactive interface using React, how to integrate an external API (Giphy) and how to perform automatic tests to ensure the proper functioning of the application.

### Project #3 | 05-hook-app

#### Description

The project is a complete web application that serves as a learning and practice platform for all React Hooks. In addition, automatic tests will be implemented using Jest to guarantee the correct functioning of the Hooks and components in the application. The main goal of this project is to provide a central place to explore and practice using each Hook in different situations, while developing a solid understanding of automated testing.

### Project #4 | 07-heroes-spa

#### Description

The project is a single page application (SPA) that allows users to explore and search for information about Marvel and DC Comics heroes. Users will be able to view hero details, compare stats, save favorite heroes, and discover interesting information about their favorite characters. The main goal of this project is to build an interactive experience using React, get hero data from external sources, and ensure code quality with automated testing using Jest.

### Project #5 | 08-journal-app

#### Description

The project is a web application that allows users to create journal notes, save titles, descriptions, and even images associated with each entry. The app uses Firebase as the backend platform to store and manage the notes in the Firestore, and Jest is used to write automated tests that ensure the integrity and functionality of the app.

### Project #6 | 09-toolkit-redux-app

#### Description

The project is a web application that combines two features: a simple counter and the display of information about pokemon obtained from the Poke API. Redux Toolkit will be used to manage the state of the application, and Jest will be used to write automatic tests that ensure the correct operation of both the counter and the integration with the Poke API.

### Project #7 | 10-calendar-app

#### Description

The project is a web application that allows users to create and manage events in an interactive calendar. Users will be able to add events with details such as title, date, time, and description, and will be able to view, modify, and delete existing events. React will be used to build the user interface and Jest will be used to write automatic tests that ensure the correct operation of event handling.
