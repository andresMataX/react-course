## üìö Descriptions

### Project #1 - 03-counter-app-vite

**Description:**
The project is a simple web application that allows users to increment or decrement a counter and see its value updated on screen. The main goal of this project is to provide a clear and concise example of how to build a basic React application and how to write automated tests using the Jest testing framework.

### Project #2 - 04-giff-app

**Description:**
The project is a web application that allows users to search for GIFs based on their search queries. It uses the Giphy API to get search results in real time and display the corresponding GIFs on the screen. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to build an interactive interface using React, how to integrate an external API (Giphy) and how to perform automatic tests to ensure the proper functioning of the application.

### Project #3 - 05-hook-app

The project is a single page application (SPA) that allows users to explore and search for information about Marvel and DC Comics heroes. Users will be able to view hero details, compare stats, save favorite heroes, and discover interesting information about their favorite characters. The main goal of this project is to build an interactive experience using React, get hero data from external sources, and ensure code quality with automated testing using Jest.

### Project #5 - 08-journal-app

**Description:**
The project is a web application that allows users to create journal notes, save titles, descriptions, and even images associated with each entry.
