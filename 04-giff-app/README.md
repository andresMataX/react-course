# Project #2 - 04-giff-app

## Description

The project is a web application that allows users to search for GIFs based on their search queries. It uses the Giphy API to get search results in real time and display the corresponding GIFs on the screen. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to build an interactive interface using React, how to integrate an external API (Giphy) and how to perform automatic tests to ensure the proper functioning of the application.
